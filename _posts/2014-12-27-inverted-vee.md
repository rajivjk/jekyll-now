A few days ago, I put together a inverted vee antenna in the backyard. I have been having a lot of fun since then.

The basic materials I used for setting these up are the following:

1. [A 20 foot Jackite Black Fiberglass Pole ](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000H43SYE/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
2. [Channel Master 3079 Antenna Mount Kit](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002SAOHH2/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o02_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1)
3. [A MFJ 20m-6m dipole antenna](http://www.mfjenterprises.com/Product.php?productid=MFJ-1779C)

I borrowed a antenna analyzer from a co-worker and after making some adjustments, I got an SWR reading of 1.3:1 at 14.300Mhz. That was good enough for me. I then hooked this up to my FRG-7. You can watch a cool video of the result here...
