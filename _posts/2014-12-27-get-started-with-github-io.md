title: Get Started with Github.io in 15 minutes!
---

I have tried a bunch of different blogging platforms (blogspot, wordpress etc), but all of them felt a little heavy. I wanted something that can be easy as editing in a plain text editor and uploading with a button. While some hacks exists for doing such things for the usual platforms, I was too bored to go back. I learned about github pages pretty randomly and since then I have fallen in love with it :thumbsup:. 

I spent an afternoon trying to get my own *.github.io page going, but ultimately I think I have nailed down the quickest way to get started. So here is how you can be up and running (or flying) in 15 minutes.

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/takeoff.jpeg)

1. Head over to Barry Clark's awesome [*Jekyll-Now*](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) page and fork his repo.
2. Once you have done that, rename it to yourgithubusername.github.io
3. Navigate to yourgithubusername.github.io

Presto! Your github page is set up!!

Now clone this repo to your local machine, navigate to the _posts folder, copy the initial post to make another post and you are set.

There are a few things to keep in mind though, else things won't work as planned.

1. Your filename should end in md.
2. Once you have made a change, you can see a preview by running jekyll in your localhost and checking out the changes. This is usually better since github.io can take some time for presenting you with your nifty changes. To find out how to do this, check out the "Local Development" section in the [*Jekyll-Now*](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) page. Once you are satisfied with the changes, you can then push the change to the master repo.

That's it folks, its that simple.
